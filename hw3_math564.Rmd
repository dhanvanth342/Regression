## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Question 3
```{r}
#set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
#set the number of datapoints
n <- 1000
#generate x values 
x <- runif(n, min = 0, max = 10) #random values between 0 and 10

#generate epsilon values (normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 3)
epsilon <- rnorm(n, mean=0, sd = sqrt(3))

#compute y values based on the equation y = 2+7x + epsilon
y = 2+7*x+epsilon
#combine x and y into a data frame
data <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

#write data to a csv file
write.csv(data, "simulated_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#confirmation
cat("Data saved to 'simulated_data.csv")

```
```{r}
df <- read.csv("simulated_data.CSV", header = TRUE, sep =",")
#re-assigning the feature labels
x1 <- df$x
y1 <- df$y


#using builtin regression function
#for Y onto X
#b
model1<- lm(y1 ~ x1)
options(digits = 9)
#c
summary(model1)
#d
plot(x1,y1)
#e
abline(model1)
```

## Question 4
```{r}
#set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
#set the number of datapoints
n <- 1000
#generate x values 
x <- runif(n, min = 0, max = 10) #random values between 0 and 10

#generate epsilon values (normally distributed with mean 0 and variance x^2)
epsilon <- rnorm(n, mean=0, sd = x^2)

#compute y values based on the equation y = 2+7x + epsilon
y = 2+7*x+epsilon
#combine x and y into a data frame
data <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

#write data to a csv file
write.csv(data, "simulated_data_nonconstant_variance.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#confirmation
cat("Data saved to 'simulated_data_nonconstant_variance.csv")
```

```{r}
df2 <- read.csv("simulated_data_nonconstant_variance.csv", header = TRUE, sep =",")
#re-assigning the feature labels
x2 <- df2$x
y2 <- df2$y


#using builtin regression function
#for Y onto X
#b
model2<- lm(y2 ~ x2)
options(digits = 9)
#c
summary(model2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
#d
plot(x2,y2)
#e
abline(model2)
#f
plot(x1,y1)
abline(model1)

```

f)
In the above graphs we can observe the difference in two plots where y2 is nonlinearly distributed with increase in x (var(epsilon) = x^2), but in case 1, since the variance is constant, there is a linear relationship between y and x. 
So, we can conclude that variance of epsilon in non linear data points is not constant. 
In order to address this non linear relationship, we can apply transformations like log to convert to linear.
