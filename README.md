🚀 Dive Into Regression – Beyond Y = mx + c! 🎯
When most people think of regression, they imagine a straight line: Y = mx + c. But regression is so much more than that!

Regression is a powerful tool that can:

📊 Select the most important features in your data.
🔍 Reveal the underlying distribution of your variables.
🎯 Explain which features contribute most to the variance in the target variable.
And that's just the beginning!
