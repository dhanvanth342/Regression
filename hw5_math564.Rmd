## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## 4
```{r}
df <- read.csv("Advertising-1.CSV", header = TRUE, sep =",")
summary(df)
head(df)
```

```{r}
model1 <- lm(sales ~ TV + radio, data =df)
new_data <- data.frame(TV = 100, radio = 20)
prediction <- predict(model1, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence", level =0.95)
prediction_interval <- predict(model1, newdata = new_data, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)

#Displaying the results
print(prediction) #printing CI
print(prediction_interval) #printing PI
```
Before answering the questions, let me explain CI and PI in brief.

## Confidence Interval: 
C.I estimates the mean response(y cap) for a given value of x(independent features) (i.e in finding the expectation of y). In finding expectancy of y, the error will be reduced to zero

## Prediction Interval:
P.I predicts the individual new response for given values of x (tv, radio, newspaper)


## a) What is the average sales when $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 on radio advertising?

As explained, the average sales values for particular expense in tv and radio advertising is given by fit value of Confidence Interval which is 11.25647

## b) What is the predicted sales for a specific market when $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 on radio advertising?
The predicted sales for given expenses on tv and radio is given by fit value of P.I which is 11.25647.

## c) Construct a 95% confidence interval for estimating the average sales under the same advertising expenditures as in (a) and (b).
Here we need to construct 95% confidence interval for estimating average sales. So we use values of upper bound, lower bound in C.I.

## d) Construct a 95% prediction interval for predicting the sales of a specific market under the same advertising expenditures as in (a) and (b).
The 95% P.I for predicting sales of specific market under same advertising expenditures as given by lower and upper bound of P.I:
